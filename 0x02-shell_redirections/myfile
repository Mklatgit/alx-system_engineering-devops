This document seeks to highlight step by step the processes that are involve when carrying out Ecosure Realisation and Invoicing, and also enabling Premium Collections.

A brief description of the tasks is below:

Realisation – this is the process of applying balance to each policy for the period of collection. Premium collections collected during the month are not applied directly to policy but instead sit in policy balance, this was done so that any dispute collection can be reversed. The realisation job will then apply this balance to the policy. It will also expire any OPEN invoice, and CLOSE all successfully paid invoices. All unpaid invoices are expired and also those policies that have skipped premiums above 3 will have their POLICIES closed. 

Invoicing – process of opening an invoice for each active policy to advise how much is due from each policy each month as premium payment for cover for that month. 

Steps involved:

1. a. set correct realisation period for the realisation
